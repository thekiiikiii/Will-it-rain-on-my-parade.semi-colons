**Challenge:** Will It Rain On My Parade? (Earth Science Division)

## üåü Project Overview

This application provides a **personalized climate risk assessment** for any location and time of the year, going beyond short-term weather forecasting. By analyzing decades of open source NASA and partner agency data, the tool calculates the statistical **likelihood** (probability) that user-defined "adverse" weather thresholds will be exceeded for a future event.

## üöÄ Key Features

1.  **Personalized Thresholds:** Users define what constitutes "adverse" (e.g., above 30¬∞C, or over 20 mm of rain/day).
2.  **Probability Risk Meter:** Provides a clear, single-percentage risk score based on historical frequency.
3.  **Trend Analysis:** Uses time-series visualization to show if the *probability* of the chosen adverse condition has increased or decreased over the last 30 years (illustrating local climate change impact).
4.  **Transparent Data Output:** Offers full data subset and metadata download (CSV/JSON) including units and original NASA/CPTEC source links, meeting open science standards.

## üíª Technical Implementation

| Component | Technology | Data Sources Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Front-End/Dashboard** | **Streamlit (Python)** | Rapidly creates an interactive, web-based dashboard. |
| **Backend/Data Processing** | **Python (Pandas, Numpy)** | Handles historical data filtering, unit conversion, and statistical calculation. |
| **Data Sources** | **NASA Earthdata** | Primarily **MERRA-2** (Temperature, Wind) and **GPM** (Precipitation). |
| **Partner Data** | **CPTEC/INPE (Brazil)** | Integrated to show higher resolution climate trends for the South American region (demonstrates international partnership use). |
